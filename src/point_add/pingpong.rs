//! The ping-pong modular divider: `numerator *= denominator^{-1} (mod p)`, and
//! its inverse `numerator *= denominator`.
//!
//! # The walk
//!
//! `u` and `v` run a fixed-depth binary extended-GCD recurrence seeded with
//! `u = p`, `v = denominator`.  Rounds 0 and 1 lift the pair into the invariant
//! (see [`round0_forward`] and [`round1_forward`]); every later round is
//!
//! ```text
//!     target <- (target + (-1)^sign * source) / 2,   sign = bit 1 of target ^ source
//! ```
//!
//! with `target` and `source` alternating between `u` and `v`.  Both values stay
//! odd, and `sign` is exactly the choice that keeps the halved sum odd.  Their
//! magnitudes shrink, so [`width_schedule`] narrows the registers as it goes and
//! hands the freed wires back to the allocator; bit 0, being a constant one for
//! the whole walk, never occupies a wire at all (see [`park_odd_bits`]).
//!
//! One `sign` qubit per round is kept: the **tape**.
//!
//! # The replay
//!
//! The same round sequence, driven by the tape, is replayed on a second pair of
//! registers (`coefficient`, `numerator`) as modular halvings — which is what
//! turns the GCD into a division.  The tape is fully live while it is replayed,
//! so the tape length is the dominant term in peak width and the replay is where
//! nearly all the Toffoli go.
//!
//! # Interleaving
//!
//! Replaying only at the end would need the whole tape *and* a full-width walk
//! state at once, so [`Plan`] splits the rounds three ways: rounds below `r1`
//! are replayed in one batch once the walk has passed them, rounds in
//! `r1..=r2` are replayed round by round beside the walk, and rounds above `r2`
//! are replayed at the terminal state, where the walk registers collapse to two
//! sign wires and can be loaned to the allocator wholesale.
//!
//! Every carry ladder inside that region is sized against the width left over,
//! and both the replay's ([`chunked_add`]) and the walk's ([`walk_low_chunk`])
//! ask the builder for it rather than modelling it — so peak width is a cap the
//! construction works within, not an outcome.
//!
//! # Direction
//!
//! [`PingPongDirection::Multiply`] is the exact time-reverse of `Divide`: it
//! walks first and replays on the way back, with the doubling cell in place of
//! the halving one.

/// out `None` on their own — the ladder has room and no split is called for.
///
/// The two rejections below are both exact, not margins:
///
///   * `low < 4` is where the single ladder still fits. It is three wires
///     lighter than the formula above assumes — no boundary wire, and its two
///     lowest carries are classical ([`walk_add_single`]) — so it peaks at
///     `live + m - 3`, which is under the cap for every `low <= 3`.
///   * `2*low <= n` is the low chunk's own footprint: it holds `low - 1` wires
///     against the high chunk's `m - low`, so a split past the midpoint would
///     move the binding moment rather than relieve it. Splitting cannot help
///     there, and the pinned configuration never reaches it.
///
/// The other two conditions are neither. `low + 2 <= n` is implied by

/// [`walk_add_split`]'s `low < m` assert is in. `n < 12` excludes the narrowest

/// build and neither ever binds -- a round narrow enough for the `n < 12` test
/// never reaches `low >= 4` anyway -- so at this budget `low < 4` is the only
/// live rejection.
